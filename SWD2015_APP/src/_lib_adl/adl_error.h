  This document describes the public Error service interface of the ADL software element.
  
  @section adl_error_public_IFS_INTRODUCTION Introduction
  
  @subsection adl_error_public_IFS_REMINDER Reminder
  
  Interfaces are the means by which software elements interact. An interface is a list of operations providing a coherent service.
  Software elements should have as much (independent) interfaces than of managed services.
  Uses the interface specification
  - To software element developers: provides the contract that states what the provider has to implement to meet the services promised by the interface.
  - To software element users: provides the contract that states what the client needs to do to use the interface.

  @section adl_error_public_IFS_ftr Features
  
  ADL supplies Error service interface to allow the application to cause & intercept fatal errors, and also to retrieve stored back-trace logs.
  
  The defined operations are:
  - A <b>subscription</b> function (adl_errSubscribe()) to register an error event handler
  - An <b>unsubscription</b> function (adl_errUnsubscribe()) to cancel this event handler registration
  - An <b>error handler</b> callback (#adl_errHdlr_f) to be notified each time a fatal error occurs
  - An <b>error request</b> function (adl_errHalt()) to cause a fatal error
  - A <b>cleaning</b> function (adl_errEraseAllBacktraces()) to clean the back-traces storage area
  - An <b>analysis status</b> function (adl_errGetAnalysisState()) to retrieve the current back-trace analysis status
  - An <b>analysis start</b> function (adl_errStartBacktraceAnalysis()) to start the back-trace analysis
  - A <b>retrieve</b> function (adl_errRetrieveNextBacktrace()) to retrieve the next back-trace buffer for the current analysis
  
  @section adl_error_public_IFS_sample Code Sample
  
  The code sample below illustrates a nominal use case of the ADL Error service public interface (error cases are not handled)
  
  @code
// Error Event handler
bool MyErrorHandler ( u16 ErrorID, ascii * ErrorStr )
{
    // Nothing to do but accept the reset
    return TRUE;
}

// Error string
const ascii * MyErrorString = "Application Generated Error";

// Error launch function
void MyFunction1 ( void )
{
    // Subscribe to error service
    adl_errSubscribe ( MyErrorHandler );
    
    // Cause an error
    adl_errHalt ( ADL_ERR_LEVEL_APP + 1, MyErrorString );
}

// Error service unsubscription function
void MyFunction2 ( void )
{
    // Unsubscribe from error service
    adl_errUnsubscribe ( MyErrorHandler );
}

// Backtraces analysis event handler
u8 * MyAnalysisFunction ( void )
{
    // Start analysis
    s8 AnalysisHandle = adl_errStartBacktraceAnalysis();
    
    // Get state
    adl_errAnalysisState_e State = adl_errGetAnalysisState();
    
    // Retrieve next backtrace size
    u8 * Buffer = NULL;
    u32 Size = adl_errRetrieveNextBacktrace ( AnalysisHandle, Buffer, 0 );
    
    // Retrieve next backtrace buffer
    Buffer = adl_memGet ( Size );
    adl_errRetrieveNextBacktrace ( AnalysisHandle, Buffer, Size );
    
    // Erase all backtraces
    adl_errEraseAllBacktraces();
    
    // Return backtrace buffer
    return Buffer;
